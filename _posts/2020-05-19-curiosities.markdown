## How do I want to use this space?

I fully expect no one to ever read this. So rather than writing for an audience, I’d like to write for myself.

I’ve found that writing is the best way for me to learn about something new. Writing forces you to “map” the space in detail, to grapple with its curves and nuances, in a way that a lively conversation doesn’t. So, my goal, at least for the time being, will be that of a cartographer.

To start, I put together a list of things I’d like to learn more about. I tried to be prolific rather than measured, so not all of these are well-scoped topics of interest. But they are each ideas I find myself coming back to again and again.
I’ll keep adding to this list over time, and I’ll also update this list with everything I’ve written or learned about a topic.

##What am I curious about?

* “File cabinet businesses”: Businesses that run “out of a file cabinet.” Not necessarily small businesses (in fact, bigger is more interesting to me), but businesses that haven’t seen the need to transition fully to software. This feels like such a big blind spot for me. It’s easy, when you work in tech to assume that all businesses are like yours…living off a laptop, pushing more and more processes to the cloud by default. But of course this isn’t the case. I want to broaden my perspective here.
* Finding order in chaos: There are things that we think of as being “the way they ought to be” and the result of thoughtful consideration but are actually just second order effects of other constraints (e.g. from my friend Saurya - Twitter limited tweets to 140 characters because they were sent in by SMS, and SMS was limited to 140 characters because SMS messages were sent via cell towers on the back of calls and there wasn’t enough space for longer messages). I find these stories fascinating. There’s chaos in the world, and it’s comforting to find order in it…to assume that decisions were made carefully. But how often are we all just kind of rolling with the punches? What are all the examples of this?
* Somewhat related to the above: unintended consequences. Like how the invention of industrial scale high fructose corn syrup, and the modern obesity epidemic, is at least partially the result of Fidel Castro’s erratic sugar production policy, which pushed us to find alternatives.
* Filter bubbles: Popping filter bubbles related to things that I love, e.g. movies, food. I recently moved to London, and the other day I Googled for a list of the “best” movies. Google pointed me to a top 100 list from the British Film Institute, and it was fascinating. There were a handful of American movies, sure, but the list was mostly French, Italian, and Soviet films that were nowhere to be found on AFI’s top 100 list. I know intuitively these types of filter bubbles exist, but I was still surprised by how different the lists were. It was like scrolling through a different world of cinema. And the UK and the USA share a whole lot of cultural touchstones! What does that list look like in other parts of the world? You might think you see the world from where you sit, but try moving just a few degrees and look at what shows up on the horizon.
* Seeing history clearly: Historian Jill Lepore has, more than any other writer, opened up my eyes to the inherent challenges in seeing our own history clearly. I want to investigate this more. A few examples:
    * Primary sources. As Lepore writes at the beginning of her recent book These Truths, “History is the study of what remains, what’s left behind, which can be almost anything, so long as it survives the ravages of time and war….[s]ome of these things are saved by chance or accident….[b]ut most of what historians study survives because it was purposely kept.” All of it - the “accidental and the intentional” form the historical record, which is “maddeningly uneven, asymmetrical, and unfair.” It is our job as consumers of history, as modern humans seeking to understand our past, to be cautious and thoughtful.
    * Polling. The first Gallup poll - presented as “public opinion” - was in reality “the opinion of Americans who were disproportionately educated, white, and male. Nationwide, in the nineteen-thirties and forties, blacks constituted about ten per cent of the population but made up less than two per cent of Gallup’s survey respondents. Because blacks in the South were generally prevented from voting, Gallup assigned no “Negro quota” in those states. As the historian Sarah Igo has pointed out, “Instead of functioning as a tool for democracy, opinion polls were deliberately modeled upon, and compounded, democracy’s flaws.”” (All from this fantastic piece by Lepore in the New Yorker). This is not to say polls aren’t useful. But we shouldn’t look at historical polling numbers and conclude that the country used to be less divided, either. It’s likely that the people who disagreed just weren’t being counted.

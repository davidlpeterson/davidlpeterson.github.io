I've realized that in some cases I find competition with others motivating and inspiring, and in other cases I find it extremely demotivating (and even jealousy-inducing). How could that be?

I was discussing this with the inimitable [Saurya Velagapudi](https://www.twitter.com/saurya) yesterday and had a revelation. 

For me, competition falls in to two categories.
* **Achievable**: I want to achieve this, and while I'm not close, I have *some* idea of how to get there. I see the path. Or I know how to get to the path.
* **Unachievable**: I want to achieve this, but I have no idea how to get there and I haven't prioritized figuring it out.

Whenever the competition falls into the first category, I find it incredibly motivating. Even if the person I'm comparing myself to is so far ahead that I could never catch up (e.g. looking at the power output of a pro cyclist in comparison to my decidedly weak weekend rides), their achievement helps me clarify the path forward for myself.

Whenever the competition falls into the second category, however, I find it incredibly demotivating. It shines a light on my own unpreparedness. "You want to achieve this, and you don't even know how to start. And look at this person. You're falling behind!" Unfortunately, my gut reaction to that is one of jealousy and frustration.

Okay, that's a helpful distinction. But how can I get more inspiring motivation in my life, and less jealous demotivation?

This where goals and anti-goals come in.

### What's a goal?

A goal is specific enough to be useful, but vague enough to let you figure out how to get there in real time. Think objectives, not tactics.

For me, a good timeline is 12-18 months.

### What's an anti-goal?

Anti-goals are "false idols" (h/t Saurya). They either won't make you happy, or they aren't a priority. But they are tempting. They're easy to fall back to and focus on. 

This doesn't mean they're necessary *bad*. They could be lots of fun. But they're an "anti-goal" because *focusing* on them isn't a priority. That's the key.

### Using goals and anti-goals to find balance

What I realized is that having a clear set of goals and anti-goals can help me control my emotional response to competition.

Whenever I start feeling that jealous-inducing, demotivation coming on, I just need to look at my goals and anti-goals and ask myself: Is this a goal? If not, should it be? If not, then who cares? Focus on what matters. Play your own game, don't play somebody else's.

I also realized that some goals are two sides of the same coin. In other words, if I'm not doing well with "Goal 1" then I'm tempted by "Anti-Goal 1," because it's easy to fall back on. However, because I haven't been focusing on "Anti-Goal 1", what drives me is often some form of jealousy, rather than any sort of strategic focus. And then I get disappointed in myself for not focusing on "Goal 1." And then the cycle continues.

I'm honestly getting tired just thinking about it.

So, to keep myself honest, I'm posting my current version of goals and anti-goals here. These aren't perfect. They need to be updated. But I'm hoping that they'll help me find balance and clarity.

### Goals:

1. **Own my career** - converge on a path to start my own company and achieve financial freedom. The goal here is all about gaining clarity on the *path* and recognizing that any career is a repeated, infinite game (not a ladder).
2. **Friends** - build deeper, authentic relationships with the people I care about most.
3. **Fitness** - focus on continual improvement in cycling, running and lightweight strength training. 
4. **World exploration** - I just moved to London. What?! Take advantage of it. Travel, get out in the world, go to new places and meet new people. Say yes to more things more often.
5. **Getting to know myself** - work on getting better at expressing my own emotions and advocating for my opinions.

### Anti-goals:
1. **Near-term career advancement** - this is *the* classic false idol for me. David from the future, read this: Don't get caught up in near-term career advancement. It's a local maxima. Donâ€™t let it distract from the global maxima (see Goal 1).
2. **Meetings for the sake of meeting** - Too often, I open my calendar to see meetings that aren't helping me achieve any of the above goals. They end up just completely draining me of the energy I need *to* achieve those goals.
3. **BREAD** - I love baking, but I don't need to prioritize it. Continual improvement isn't the name of the game right now. Just enjoy it for what it is.
